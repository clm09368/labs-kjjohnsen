## Assignment Notes
I completed everything on the assignment.  The only thing I wasn't sure about was how to handle the small differences between the default plots in Matlab and Python, at least where the lab wasn't specific.  So, I opted to go with the defaults.  This means they look different.  

## Reflection
To be completed.
