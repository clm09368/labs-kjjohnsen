# Kyle Johnsen's Lab 2
## Assignment Notes

Everything went well in the lab.  The hardest part, by far, was typing the morse code.  I used chatgpt to generate my morse code table.  I also found code for pyaudio from various places on the web, but ultimately simplified that down into a function call to make a short or long beep.
